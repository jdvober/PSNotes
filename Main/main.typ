== What is Matter?
<what-is-matter>
#block[
\# Matter is the "stuff" that makes up everything in the universe.

\# Properties of Matter \#\# Each specific substance has its own
combination of properties that can be used to identify the substance.
\#\# ($star.filled$)!red!$Delta$ means \"Change\" \#\#\# Ex. Water is a
\#\#\#\# Liquid at room temperate \#\#\#\# Solid at cold temperatures
\#\#\#\# Gas at high temperatures \#\# Examples: \#\#\# Hardness \#\#\#
Texture \#\#\# Flammability \#\#\# Color \#\#\# Shape \#\#\# Temperature

This is some text that I want to put a side margin note in for.
($star.filled$)!orange!Test side note

== Kinds of Matter
<kinds-of-matter>
\# Elements

\#\# If you break down an element any more, then it just becomes generic
#emph[protons];, #emph[neutrons] and #emph[electrons];. \#\#\# It stops
behaving like that element

- Ex: If you break down Gold into protons, neutrons and electrons, it is
  no longer a shiny metal that conducts electricity.

\#\# Each element has its own symbol \#\#\# Usually the first 1 - 2
letters in the name \#\#\# \#\#\# Examples

-

-

- C $arrow.r$ #underline[C];arbon

- H $arrow.r$ #underline[H];ydrogen

- Al $arrow.r$ #underline[Al];uminum

- Au $arrow.r$

\# Compounds

\#\# Examples \

- $C_6 H_12 O_6$

- $N a C l$

- $C H_4$

- $C O_2$

- $C a C O_3$

- $A l (O H)_3$

\# Mixtures

\#\# Ex: Well Water \#\#\# Well water is a mixture because it has
minerals, salts, and even dissolved oxygen within it

\#\# Before it is ripped, it is paper \#\# After it is ripped, it is
still paper \#\#\# Thus, this is an example of a #emph[physical change.]
\#\# Other examples \#\#\# Melting Ice \#\#\# Smashing a rock

\# Chemical Changes

\#\# Examples

- Burning Wood

- Iron Rusting

- Mixing Baking Soda and Vinegar
